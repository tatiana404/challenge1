## Refactoring of web page code

## Description

This web page code refactoring shows my ability to look through  the source code and find semantic HTML elements. Improve a given code by editing structure, style,position of elements and adding working links. This is my first attempt to refactor the existing cone to make it semantically correct. In order ti use <div> tags I used <header>, <article>, <section>, <aside> and <footer> tags where appropriate. 


## Usage

The following links lead to gitgub repository with my project and  application live URL.
